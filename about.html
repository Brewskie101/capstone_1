<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I currently live in the beatiful state of Colorado but am originally from South Carolina. Most of my adult life has been spent in the service/hospitality industry.  I started waiting tables in college and went head first into it after deciding college wasn't for me. After deciding the life of a bartender isn't for me I mostly stuck to delivery but for the past 7 years have been an Uber/Lyft driver.  I am now looking for a more fullfilling career in web and software development.</p>
